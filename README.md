# Data Analysis

## Certificate

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Coursera Google Data Analytics.

The Coursera Online Data Analyst Program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 

I am constantly improving my skills proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

## Projects
The Tableau workbook files for each Project can be found in the projects folder

### Florida Population by County
This simple dashboard was my first time working in Tableau. Using data from Census.gov I was able to generate this simple interactive dashboard.

### World Happiness
This project uses data to display happiness across the nations, I have added in Life Expectancy and Freedom for additional values for comparison. The dashboards show charts comparining values like life expectancy vs happiness.
