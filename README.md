# Data Analysis

## Certificate

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Coursera Google Data Analytics.

Coursera online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am constantly improving my skills proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

## Projects

This simple dashboard was my first time working in Tableau. Using data from Census.gov I was able to generate this simple interactive dashboard.
