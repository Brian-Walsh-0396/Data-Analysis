# Data Analysis - Brian Walsh

## About
Hi, I'm Brian! I have a technical background and hold a Bachelors of Applied Science(BAS) degree in Supervison and Management (Polk State College), majoring in Business Information Techologu. I had worked for 4 years in technolgoy playing roles as a Support Speclaist, Intern, and as a Implemenaaion Speclalist. After one year of transition from Implenentation to Data Analysis, I'm Data Analyst looking for new oppertunities. 

## Certificate

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Coursera Google Data Analytics.

The Coursera Online Data Analyst Program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 

I am constantly improving my skills proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

## Projects
The Tableau workbook files for each Project can be found in the projects folder. All coding projects in the Python folder contain the relivant csv files as well as the code file. 

### Florida Population by County
This simple dashboard was my first time working in Tableau. Using data from Census.gov I was able to generate this simple interactive dashboard.

### World Happiness
This project uses data to display happiness across the nations, I have added in Life Expectancy and Freedom for additional values for comparison. The dashboards show charts comparining values like life expectancy vs happiness.

## Python
These projects were done as a part of the course, the rough code was supplied for me to analyise and complete the projects.
