# Data Analysis - Brian Walsh

## About
Hi, I'm Brian! I have a technical background and hold a Bachelors of Applied Science(BAS) degree in Supervison and Management (Polk State College), majoring in Business Information Techology. I have worked for 4 years in technolgoy playing roles as a Support Speclaist, Intern, and as a Implementation Speclalist. During my schooling I was taught "Data is the new oil" as I worked to implement software and saw the needs of my clients I learned first hand how true this is. This inspired me to take the [Coursera Google Data Analytics Program](https://bit.ly/3zrdKdK)

The Coursera Online Data Analyst Program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 

I am constantly improving my skills proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib), SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

## Projects
The Tableau workbook files for each Project can be found in the projects folder. All coding projects in the Python folder contain the relivant csv files as well as the code file. 

### Capstone: Bike Share
**Code:**[Code](https://github.com/Brian-Walsh-0396/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Projects/Capstone)

**Description:** In this project I was asked to review the data from the users from the last year (August 2021-July 2022) and determine the best practices moving forward for the company. We saw that casual users slight beat out (+2%) membership users, additional member teirs could help convert users. I also saw that docked bikes make up the smallest share and could be phased out. Lastly, I discovered taht Mondays and Tuesdays are the slowest days for the rentals, a deal for members or a coupon for casual users could incentivise riders.

**Tools used** Pycharm, Numby, Pandas, plotly

### Florida Population by County
This simple dashboard was my first time working in Tableau. Using data from Census.gov I was able to generate this simple interactive dashboard.

### World Happiness
This project uses data to display happiness across the nations, I have added in Life Expectancy and Freedom for additional values for comparison. The dashboards show charts comparining values like life expectancy vs happiness.

### Global CO2
This project shows differnt mappings of CO2 Data with differnt specifications. The Linked Data file presetns the same information but pulls in data from other sources and uses filtering to years, CO2 per capita, and energy usage.

## Python
These projects were done as a part of the course, the rough code was supplied for me to analyise and complete the projects. 

### Smart Watch Data
**Code:**[Fianl Code](https://github.com/Brian-Walsh-0396/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Projects/Python/Smartwatch%20Data%20Analysis/Code.py)

**Description:** As smart watches and fitness trackers grow more popular, tracking data form users becomes more and more important in the world of health monitoring. 

**Tools used** Pycharm, Numby, Pandas, plotly

### Netflix Analysis
**Code:**[netflix.py](https://github.com/Brian-Walsh-0396/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Projects/Python/Netflix%20Analysis/main.py)

**Description:** As Netflix reports losses and tests less than popular descions looking at where the suceeded may help pull the company back into favor

**Tools used** Pycharm, Numby, Pandas, plotly
